2018-05-08:
- Fixed a bug that prevented use of PSD as Monte Carlo simulation window.
- PSD simulation window can now also be used without strict localization.
- Modified the __run_monte_carlo() function with respect to generation
  of simulated points and the testing of their localization in the 
  simulation window to make it clearer.
- Changed icon.
- Renamed some class names for succinctness: ProfileBorderData to ProfileBorder, 
  ClusterData to Cluster, ProfileData to Profile.
- Other minor changes.
2018-04-25:
- Now works with Python 3 instead of Python 2.
- Uses openpyxl instead of pyExcelerator, and generates .xlsx files instead of
  old-format .xls files.
- Code cleanup and other minor changes.
2016-05-16:
- Bug fix.
2015-04-19:
- Further code cleanup.
- Bug fixes.
2014-11-11:
- Code cleanup and miscellaneous changes. 
- License changed to the MIT license.
2014-08-14:
- Minor bug fixes and changes.
2014-05-14:
- View file dialog is now properly destroyed when closed.
- PyExcelerator is again included in the Window binaries.
2014-01-27:
- Fixed a bug that caused a failure to execute when using the latest version
  of wxPython. 
2012-08-07:
- Fixed a bug that caused an empty randomli list to be created when the input
  file contained no random points, thereby causing an exception when the program
  tried to use the list. 
2011-10-17:
- Fixed a bug that caused the number of holes to always be shown as 0 in the
  log (the holes were correctly accounted for in the output data though).
- Fixed a bug that prevented certain options that should be reset between runs
  from actually being so.
2010-09-02:
- Fixed a bug that prevented some options from being loaded from the
  configuration file.
2010-09-01:
- Revised and cleaned up some of the code classes.py; for example, some Point
  methods are now properties.
2010-08-19:
- In the Point.__psdAssociation method, dist was calculated using perpendDist()
  instead of perpendDistClosedPath(), which now seems like a bug (testing
  confirmed that). I changed it to use the latter method instead.
2010-08-17:
- Because also random points and other particle-like points are instances of the
  Particle class, this class was for clarity renamed Point. At the same time the
  import method of the geometry module was changed, so that objects in this
  module (including the geometry.Point class) are accessed using geometry.*.
- Fixed a bug where simulated-particle and particle-simulated interpoint
  distances were never saved to output files.
2010-07-05:
- Implemented a number of things from Synapse.py, including interpoint distances
  between points and simulated points, and the option to specify Monte Carlo
  simulation window.
- Now saves current input directory to a config file named 
  '.pointdensitysyn.cfg' in the user's home directory.
- Current options can also be saved to '.pointdensitysyn.cfg'. Options specified
  in that file will be loaded when the program is started.
- "Skipping distance" was renamed "Shell width".
- The processing now takes place in a separate thread; while processing, a
  progress dialog is shown which allows for cancellation of the processing.
- A number of minor bug fixes and other changes aimed at simplifying the code.
