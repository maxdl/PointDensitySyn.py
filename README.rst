PointDensitySyn
===============

PointDensitySyn is a software tool for analysis of immunogold labeled 
electron micrographs. Specifically, it is used to analyse gold labeling in 
synapse-like structures associated with closed segmented paths (e.g., 
postsynaptic densities in dendritic spines). It is of course also possible 
to use the tool for other types of two-dimensional spatial point patterns.

PointDensitySyn is used in conjunction with its companion ImageJ plugin,
PointDensitySyn.IJ.
